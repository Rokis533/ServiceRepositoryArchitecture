# Service Repository Architecture Example

## Introduction

This project serves as an example Console application utilizing the Service Repository Architecture in C#. It is designed to demonstrate a clean separation of concerns through the use of services and repositories, promoting a scalable and maintainable codebase. This architecture aids in organizing the application into logical segments, where the Repository layer handles data access, and the Service layer contains business logic.

## Installation

To set up the project, ensure that you have .NET SDK installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory via command line or terminal.
3. Build the project using the .NET CLI command: `dotnet build`.
4. Run the application using `dotnet run`.

## Usage

This application is a console application. Once started, it will present a simple user interface in the console, demonstrating the functionalities provided by the underlying service and repository layers.

## Architecture

The project is structured into several key directories:

- **Models**: Contains the data models representing the entities in the application.
- **Repositories**: Implements the Repository pattern for data access, abstracting the data layer from the rest of the application.
- **Services**: Contains the business logic, making use of repositories to operate on data.
- **Helpers**: Utility or helper classes to support the application operations.

This separation ensures that each component is responsible for a single aspect of the application, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and test.
